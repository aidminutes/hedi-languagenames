# Languagenames in different languages
I needed names of languages in different languages. I couldn't find anything like that, so I made it myself.
I used [google translate](https://translate.google.de/) to translate the languages. So I can't vouch for the accuracy of the data.
With the translations I created a matrix in [a google table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gg4qMoCHcYzKOOGMyMFlPxYZWGK4eg9dw0ueZcIutWY/edit?usp=sharing) and then created json objects from it.
